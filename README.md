An ES6 implmentation of the tutorial by @kenwheeler: [Create a Shopping Cart Using React.js and Flux](https://scotch.io/tutorials/creating-a-simple-shopping-cart-with-react-js-and-flux)

The webpack build process is taken from the [survivejs: webpack and react](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react) tutorial, which is awesome.

**npm start** to open on http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/

**npm run build** to run a normal build
